<h2><b>Особенности:</b></h2>
🎨 <b>Attribute or skills</b>
Instead of build-in attributes such as strength, knowledge, etc.,
You can also create your own skills, such as fishing and writing.
Try adding tasks to your skills and leveling them up!
Track your level with achievements to unlock attractive rewards when you reach the goal.
The growth of attributes and skills is also equivalent to digitally reflecting your growth, prompting you to stay more motivated and powerful.

🎁 <b>Магазин</b>
Abstract your task reward into the app as a shop item, whether it is a realistic reward, a reward for rest and entertainment time, or a stat reward in the app, such as taking a 30 mins break, watching a movie, or getting a random coin reward.

🏆 <b>Достижения</b>
In addition to dozens of built-in achievements waiting for you to unlock, you can create your own to track your progress: such as auto-tracking the number of task completions, levels, and item usage times.
Or create your realistic milestones like arriving in a city!


⏰ <b>Помодоро</b>
